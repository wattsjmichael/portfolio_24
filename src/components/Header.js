      <h1>Hello, my name is Michael.</h1>
<p>
  I'm a <span>Technical Project Manager</span> and <span>VR/AR Developer</span> based in Longview, WA. 
  I transitioned from managing restaurants and non-profits to building immersive tech experiences, bringing leadership, adaptability, 
  and a builder's mindset to every project. Iâ€™ve led the development of virtual training tools for emergency preparedness, 
  launched AI-powered web apps, and collaborated with high-profile clients on cutting-edge solutions. Whether managing teams 
  or prototyping in Unity or Vue, I focus on clarity, execution, and making things that actually work.
